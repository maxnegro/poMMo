Scripts in this directory are useful for updating master .pot file for
translations. In particular, tsmarty2c.php is used to collect translation
strings from smarty templates and compile a dummy file named smarty.c, with
translation strings in "normal" xgettext format (ie _("translate me")).

In order for the script to run successfully, xgettext and php (cli
version) need to be installed on the system. The two executables are
expected to be found in /usr/bin directory.
